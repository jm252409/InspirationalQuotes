	These violent delights have violent ends
	And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
	Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
	 Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
	 And in the taste confounds the appetite:
	 Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
	 Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
